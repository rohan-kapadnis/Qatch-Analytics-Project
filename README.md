# Qatch-Analytics-Project

Qatch is a SMS-based service that offers a personalized online shopping experience for fashion customers.  Here's how it works - When users sign up for the service, they are opted to complete an onboarding quiz, which gives us an initial understanding of their preferences.  After that, they start receiving weekly recommendations by text (10-15 a week), and based on their reactions (“Loved”, “Liked” or “Disliked”) and behavior we improve our recommendations for future batches.

For this project, I have answered the question : **How can we measure success?** by developing various KPIs and visualizations over them.
